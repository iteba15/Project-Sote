# HCC and PAR Diagnosis System

## Project Description

This repository contains the implementation of a hybrid deep learning architecture for the diagnosis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) and Parasitic Liver Diseases (PAR) using ultrasound images. The project aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy and aid medical professionals by leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. The system integrates Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs) for data augmentation, Vision Transformers (ViTs) for feature extraction, and a hybrid model combining Hierarchical Transformers and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for final classification.

## Key Features

### Stage 1: Pre-processing and Feature Extraction

1. **Data Augmentation with GANs**
   - Implementation of Conditional GANs (CGANs) using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
   - Generation of synthetic ultrasound images to augment the dataset.
   - Use of advanced GAN architectures like Progressive GANs and techniques like WGAN-GP for stable training.

2. **Attention-based Feature Extraction with Transformers**
   - Utilization of pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) from the OpenAI API or Hugging Face Transformers library.
   - Fine-tuning of ViTs on a combined dataset of original and synthetic ultrasound images.
   - Exploration of alternative transformer architectures like DeiT or TNT for improved feature extraction.

### Stage 2: Deep Learning Model (Hybrid)

1. **Hierarchical Transformer with Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)**
   - Design of a hierarchical transformer with multiple encoder-decoder stages to capture features at various scales.
   - Representation of ultrasound images as graphs for GCN processing, capturing spatial context within the images.
   - End-to-end training of the hybrid model with techniques like Adam optimizer, learning rate scheduling, curriculum learning, and knowledge distillation.

### Stage 3: Hyperparameter Optimization and Activation Functions

1. **Hyperparameter Optimization**
   - Use of open-source libraries like Optuna or Ray Tune for optimizing learning rates, batch sizes, number of layers, and attention mechanism parameters.
   - Grid search or random search approaches for hyperparameter exploration, with evaluation based on accuracy, F1-score, or AUC-ROC.

2. **Activation Functions**
   - Experimentation with different activation functions (ReLU, Leaky ReLU, SiLU, GELU, Swish, and Mish) for optimal model performance.

### Stage 4: Validation, Deployment, and Scalability

1. **Validation**
   - Use of hold-out validation sets and k-fold cross-validation to assess model performance on unseen data.
   - Evaluation metrics include accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.

2. **Deployment**
   - Options for on-premise deployment or containerized deployment using AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS).
   - Focus on cost-effective deployment strategies while maintaining code portability for future cloud platform migrations.

3. **Scalability**
   - Data-parallel training using tools like Horovod or DDP.
   - Model compression techniques for deployment on resource-constrained devices, using libraries like TensorFlow Lite or PyTorch Mobile.
   - Future consideration of federated learning for collaborative data sharing without compromising patient privacy.

### Stage 5: Continuous Learning and Improvement

1. **Continuous Monitoring and Re-training**
   - Periodic re-training of the model with new data to enhance accuracy and generalization.
   - Use of incremental learning, transfer learning, and curriculum learning for continuous performance improvement.
   - Staying updated with the latest advancements in deep learning and medical diagnosis.

## Conclusion

This project aims to develop a cost-effective and scalable HCC and PAR diagnosis system using a hybrid deep learning architecture. By following this strategic implementation plan, the goal is to create a valuable tool for aiding medical professionals in the early and accurate diagnosis of liver conditions, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
